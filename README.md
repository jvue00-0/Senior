UNCC Senior Project 
<br />
<br />
This project was started in January 2020 and ended in December 2020. I must emphasize that it is not completed. This is the code that was turned in at the end of the project
regardless of full completion or not.
<br /> 
For this project, the goal was to create a robot that would be able to take a box of the LEGO Mindstorm EV3 Kit and sort all the pieces correctly as the way they came packaged. 
My job was to create an AI program to make the robot function and be able to sort those pieces. This includes being able to get the robot to identify the pieces using a camera
and generate a report at the end of the program to detail how many pieces were extra or missing. The language used to code this project was Python. Prior to this project, I had 
no experience with Python and had to learn along the way.
<br /> 
For a more detailed description of what I had to do in the project, I will post a document that I was required to write at the end of the semester that explains the 
decision making and thought process throughout the project.
